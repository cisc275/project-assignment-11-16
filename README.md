Description:
An educational game based on the killdeer bird with 3 minigames. 
Players can choose to migrate or stay and minigame lengths will change based on decision.
Game starts with the Eating minigame, where players direct the bird to collect enough food for the flight.
Once a goal is met they move on to the Migrating game, where they race against time to reach a location.
Finally, they reach a nesting location and have to distract predators to protect the bird's eggs.
Game will end with a recap quiz.
